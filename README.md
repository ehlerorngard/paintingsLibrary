This is a simple app that implements GraphQL by leveraging Apollo on the client side for making requests to the Express/Node server, which in turn utilizes express-graphql for handing GraphQL queries and connects to a Mongo database via the Mongoose ORM.  In addition to React, the client side uses Redux to manage local state (rather than using Apollo's cache management tools).
